# Code Generator

Built with: Python and Flask, itertools

## Description
This simple web app will generate codes of character combinations based on your inputted word and selected options.

The idea for this program came to me when learning about permutations in Python's intertools. I thought this could be really useful for my day job, where I sometimes need to create 3-character codes based on a name. After googling unsuccessfully for a website that could show me all possible 3-character combinations of a word - I decided to build it myself.

## Instructions
Fill in the form and press submit.

**Word / Phrase** - Type in the word or phrase that you wish to create a code from. 

**Number of characters** - The desired length of your code

**Code must begin with the first character**? - Select this option if you want to ensure that your generated codes all start with the first character of your word / phrase.

A warning will be displayed if you submit without any input, or if the input is shorter than the number selected for 'number of characters'.
